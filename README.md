# Middleware-evaluation-in-an-IoT-application

ABSTRACT - 
Internet of Things (IoT) applications are nowadays widely
used both for domestic and industrial purposes. However
they still represent a rather large implementation challenge.

On this project a temperature sensor will be used to automat-
ically send out warnings about the air quality. This sensor

is connected to a NodeMCU ESP8266 that has an internet
connection and in addition two different middlewares will
be used which are a software that provides services and
resources common to applications.
Once the design and implementation of the IOT application
is done, a comparison of the two middlewares used will be
made.
